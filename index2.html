			<h2>Day 1: Houston</h2>
			<timestamp>Posted: May 30th, 2016</timestamp>
			<p>
				On Saturday and Sunday, I made the voyage from my home in Iowa to my new home in Texas for the next seven weeks. I am staying in a hotel near the center of Houston for an internship with Smith & Associates. I don't officially start my internship until Wednesday June 1st. I thought it would be a good opportunity to familarize myself with the city a little bit before I started working. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One thing I noticed while driving through Texas the past couple days is that driving here can be a bit overwhelming! There were two times where I had a driver pull out in front of me, nearly causing me to crash into them. Being in the middle of Houston, there is a lot of traffic coming and going. It is very fast paced and it can be a bit overwhelming at times. In Iowa, the roads are mostly one lane on either side of the road, with some of the highways being two lane on either side. That is the type of roads I am used to. In Houston, there are roads with as many as six lanes on either side.

				Welcome to my newly designed website! Over the past couple of weeks, I have been working on giving my website a new design. I finally got around to finishing the ground work so that I could post it. The goal of this website is to promote myself. This website will tell you more about me and what I am passionate about. It will also give you some insight on my experiences and some projects I have worked on. Feel free to explore. Thank you for visiting.
